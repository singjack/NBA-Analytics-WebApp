# NBA Analytics WebApp

This is a web application I developed along with several other classmates that analyzes and visualizes data from CSV files containing analytics from NBA games ranging from 2004 to present.

This project is to showcase my proficiency in utilizing a back-end framework (Flask) to communicate with a front-end library (React) to create a cohesive web application.
